Coding style guides from Coshx Labs.

## About

These are style guidelines that we generally agree upon across our team. Preferably, when we start a new project, we'll reference the relevant style guides here, so that we can keep these centralized. But keep in mind that styles are on a per-project basis, so it's okay to deviate from this (e.g. if you just can't stand 4-space indentations in python and don't care about PEP-8).
